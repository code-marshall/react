In online poker game it is possible to cheat as a game organizers. 
Any online poker game involves following steps

#### User Registration

Normally a user would register in the game, verify themselves, and add a payment method to transfer money into wallet.

These players just look like another valid player.


#### Match making

In online games, match making is the process of creating a pool of players, which can be at same / similar level.
Game is started when everyone or given number of people join.

Organisers can modify the match making algorithm to always include 1 or 2 bots / dummy users.
These users will look like actual player.

#### Deck / Card distribution

Ideally the algorithm to shuffle & distribute cards should be sufficiently random.
Which in turn can give equal opportunity for every player to win

Organizers can modify this algorithm to increase the winning chances of bots / dummy users, by preassigned set of cards.
Here the algorithm can be modified in following way:
- Randomly distribute card, and bot / dummy user will have idea of all the users' card who are playing, therefore the strategy to call / fold is devised based on that.
- Create fix set of card combination that guarantees the win of dummy user.
- Randomly distribute card, but introduce sufficient amount of dummy user, which reduces the winning chance of actual user.
- Change algorithm in such a way that makes sure that 1st or 1st few deck are won by actual users, which keeps them in the game till end.
